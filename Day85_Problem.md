Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 67.15%Submissions: 191K+Points: 2Average Time: 15m
Given a Binary Tree, your task is to return its In-Order Traversal.

An inorder traversal first visits the left child (including its entire subtree), then visits the node, and finally visits the right child (including its entire subtree).

Follow Up: Try solving this with O(1) auxiliary space.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
      
Output: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
Explanation: The in-order traversal of the given binary tree is [4, 2, 5, 1, 3].
Input: root[] = [8, 1, 5, N, 7, 10, 6, N, 10, 6]
      
Output: [1, 7, 10, 8, 6, 10, 5, 6]
Explanation: The in-order traversal of the given binary tree is [1, 7, 10, 8, 6, 10, 5, 6].
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 105
0 <= node->data <= 105
